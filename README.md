The feature rich **ColorPicker** component for the modern web, sourced with TypeScript, Cypress tested, WAI-ARIA compliant and lots of goodies. In addition, it features its own version of [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) called simply [Color](http://github.com/thednp/color).

**ColorPicker** can use existing colour palettes or generate custom ones via DATA API configuration. If you want to play, check out [this codepen](https://codepen.io/thednp/pen/WNdRWPN) I've setup for you. Have fun!

## NPM

You can install **ColorPicker** through NPM:

```
$ npm install @thednp/color-picker
```

## Browser Usage

Download the [latest package](https://github.com/thednp/color-picker/archive/master.zip). unpack and inspect the contents. You need to copy the `color-picker.js` and `color-picker.css` or their minified variations to your app `assets` folders as follows.
Link the required CSS in your document `<head>` tag

```html
<link href="../assets/css/color-picker.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Link the required JS in your document `<body>` tag, though it should work in the `<head>` as well

```html
<script src="../assets/js/color-picker.js"></script>
```

Now you can initialize the function for your elements at the end of your `<body>` tag

```html
<script>
  var myPicker = new ColorPicker('input.SELECTOR');
</script>
```

To use the DATA-API, you can provide for instance the `data-format="hex"`, and other specific attributes like so:

```html
<label for="myPicker">Color Label</label>
<div class="color-picker">
  <input
    id="myPicker"
    name="myPicker"
    data-function="color-picker"
    data-format="hex"
    data-color-presets="red,green,blue"
    class="color-preview"
    value="#069"
  />
</div>
```

The `data-function="color-picker"` attribute is useful for mass initialization, [check this usage section of the wiki](https://github.com/thednp/color-picker/wiki/Usage#initialize-multiple-targets).

## Initialize INPUT

```javascript
import ColorPicker from '@thednp/color-picker';

const myPicker = new ColorPicker('#myPicker');
```
